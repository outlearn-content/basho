# Next Steps 

Well done, you have finished the path on Riak Data Modeling. Now that you've seen the power of Riak through different use cases, perhaps you are wondering what it would take to migrate an SQL system to Riak. We have a [path just for you](https://pilot.outlearn.com/learn/basho/migrating-sql-to-riak).

And we'd also love to get your feedback on this Path. Please use the Feedback widget on the right for any comments.
