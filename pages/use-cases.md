# Use Cases

Riak is a flexible data storage technology capable of addressing a wide variety of problems in a scalable way. In this guide, we'll list a number of use cases and data models that are a good fit for Riak. All of these use cases are already being used in production for projects large and small. We'll also suggest possibilities for implementation and provide links to videos and documentation for further exploration.

How you structure your application to run on Riak should take into account the unique needs of your use case, including access patterns such as read/write distribution, latency differences between various operations, use of Riak features including [Data Types](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/theory/concepts/crdts/), [MapReduce](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/mapreduce/), [Search](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/search/), [secondary indexes (2i)](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/2i/) and more. This guide is intended to be illustrative only.
